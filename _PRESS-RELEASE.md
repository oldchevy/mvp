There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  Improve Your Understanding of Promises by Making Music

## Sub-Heading ##
  For engineers who want to solidify their Promise writing skills and play with a cool sandbox.

## Summary ##
  This tool let's you write Promises that are wrapped around short audio clips. When you execute your sandbox code, you will be able to both hear and see exactly how your asynchronous code is behaving! This is a cool way to conceptualize writing asynchronous code, and 
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

## Problem ##
  Promises can save you from awful looking and difficult to reason about callback centered asynchronous code. But they take some getting used to and tutorials online are not always the most clear about implications for different ways to implement Promises.
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

## Solution ##
  Often, giving a more tangible example can greatly improve your understanding of an abstract concept. This tool offers an intuitive way to reason about and conceptualize what promises are doing under the hood. When you run your code snippet you will be able to both see and hear how your Promises are resolving in real time.
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

## Quote from You ##
  "This sandbox gives you an open-ended way to experiment with writing Promises! I hope you enjoy using it."
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

## How to Get Started ##
  Click on one of the examples to see the code snippet in the code entry view, and execute the code to see and hear it! Easy as that. Once you feel confident in the examples, write your own using the audio clips listed above the code box.
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

## Customer Quote ##
  "The sandbox is really easy to use and I made some sick beats."
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  To get started, just follow the instructions at the top of the page. If you are wondering what Promises are, now is a great time to learn! Head to this MDN link to learn just what Promises are all about.
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
